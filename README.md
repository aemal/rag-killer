# RAG Killer: The Rise of Giant Context Windows in LLMs

This project is a Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrating that in many cases, a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) solution might not be necessary. As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to evolve with increasingly larger context windows, the need for complex RAG implementations diminishes.

## Sample Content

This project uses "Pride and Prejudice" by Jane Austen as a sample text to demonstrate the capabilities of large context windows. The text is available in two formats:
- `book.txt`: The actual text file used for analysis and processing
- `book.pdf`: A PDF version of the same text, included only for reference to show the physical page count (not used in the model)

## Current Model Support

This PoC currently focuses on ChatGPT models, but the framework is designed to be extensible. Future versions will include support for other LLM providers and models as they become available with large context windows.

## Context Window Capabilities

The ChatGPT o3-mini model can handle approximately 200,000 tokens in its context window. To put this into perspective:

- **Token to Word Conversion**: 1,000 tokens ≈ 750 words
- **Total Words**: 200,000 tokens × 0.75 words/token = 150,000 words
- **Page Count**: 150,000 words ÷ 500 words/page = 300 A4 pages

This means the model can process the equivalent of a 300-page document in a single context window, which is approximately:
- 75,000 to 90,000 words
- 540,000 characters (including spaces and punctuation)

## Payload Size and Traffic Considerations

When considering the practical implementation of this large context window, it's important to analyze the payload size:

- **Character Size**: 540,000 characters × 2 bytes/character (UTF-8) ≈ 1.08 MB
- **Token Size**: 200,000 tokens × ~4 bytes/token ≈ 800 KB
- **Total Payload Size**: Approximately 1-2 MB per request (including metadata and formatting)

### Traffic Impact Analysis

While the payload size is significant, it's important to consider:

1. **Modern Network Capabilities**:
   - Most modern networks can handle 1-2 MB requests efficiently
   - Average broadband speeds (25+ Mbps) can transfer this in under a second
   - 5G networks can handle this payload size in milliseconds

2. **Cost-Benefit Trade-off**:
   - The increased payload size is offset by:
     - Eliminating the need for multiple API calls in RAG systems
     - Reducing database queries and storage costs
     - Simplifying the overall architecture

3. **Practical Considerations**:
   - For most use cases, you won't need the full 200,000 tokens
   - The context window provides flexibility rather than a requirement
   - You can still implement chunking for very large documents if needed

## Content Analysis Tool

The project includes a content analysis tool (`stats.ts`) that helps you understand how your content fits within different model context windows. This tool provides:

### Features
- Text statistics (words, characters, lines)
- Token estimation
- Size analysis in bytes/KB/MB
- Context window utilization percentage
- Page estimation
- Smart recommendations for content chunking

### Currently Supported Models
- ChatGPT o3-mini (200k token context window)
- 4o-mini (128k token context window)

### Future Model Support
The tool is designed to be easily extensible to support additional LLM providers and models. Future versions will include:
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet (200k tokens)
- Gemini 1.5 Pro (1M tokens)
- Other emerging models with large context windows

### Usage
1. Place your content in `book.txt`
2. Run the analysis:
```bash
bun run stats.ts
```

### Example Output
```
Analysis for ChatGPT o3-mini:
==================================================
Model Description: ChatGPT o3-mini model with 200k token context window
Context Window: 200,000 tokens

Text Statistics:
- Words: 50,000
- Characters: 250,000
- Lines: 1,000
- Estimated Pages: 100

Token Analysis:
- Estimated Tokens: 37,500
- Context Window Utilization: 18.75%

Size Analysis:
- Character Size: 500 KB
- Token Size: 150 KB
- Total Size: 650 KB

Recommendations:
✅ Content fits well within context window.
```

## Implications

This large context window suggests that for many use cases:
- Complex RAG implementations might be unnecessary
- Direct processing of documents is possible without chunking
- Real-time analysis of substantial documents is feasible
- Multiple documents can be processed simultaneously

## Setup and Usage

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.2.1. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
